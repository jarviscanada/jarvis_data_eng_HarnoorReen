**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HarnoorReen/tree/master/linux_sql)]: An application that helps track the memory usage of the host system. Uses bash scripting for scripts, PostgreSQL and Docker for database and git for version control. Also, uses crontab to run script every minute.


## Highlighted Projects
**Stock Analyzer** [[GitHub](https://github.com/reenharnoorsingh/4990-project)]: Created a full-stack stock analysis tool for the Toronto Stock Exchange, scraping data from 1,700+ companies. Designed a user-friendly interface for comparing two stock tickers with integrated algorithms (EMA, SMA, RSI) for informed decision-making, and used LSTM for price prediction based on historical data.

**Automagic Websites** [[GitHub](https://github.com/reenharnoorsingh/Automagic-Websites)]: Developed a digital CV/website platform specifically tailored to Computer Science students, enabling users to deploy custom sites 50% faster than traditional methods.

**Ethereum Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis** [[GitHub](https://github.com/reenharnoorsingh/reddit-sentiment-analysis)]: Utilized Yahoo Finance API to gather Ethereum historical price data and Reddit API to retrieve Ethereum related posts. Performed Sentiment Analysis on Reddit posts through Hugging Face RoBERTa model. Leveraged Predictive Modeling by developing a Machine Learning Model to predict Ethereum prices based on historical data and sentiment features.
